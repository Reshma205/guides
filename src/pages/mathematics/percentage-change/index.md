Percentage Change:
Subtract the old from the new, then divide by the old value. Show that as a Percentage.

            (New Value − Old Value)/|Old Value| × 100%
            (The "|" symbols mean absolute value, so negatives become positive)
            
Example: There were 200 customers yesterday, and 240 today:

             (240 − 200)/|200| × 100% =  40/200 × 100% = 20%
                    A 20% increase.

Example: But if there were 240 customers yesterday, and 200 today we would get:

              (200 − 240)/|240| × 100% =   −40/240 × 100% = −16.6...%
                    A 16.6...% decrease.
