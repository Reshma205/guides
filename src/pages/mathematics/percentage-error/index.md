Percentage Error:

The difference between Approximate and Exact Values, as a percentage of the Exact Value.
             
             (|Approximate Value − Exact Value|)/|Exact Value| * 100%
           (The "|" symbols mean absolute value, so negatives become positive)
           
Example: I thought 70 people would turn up to the concert, but in fact 80 did!

            (|70 − 80|)/|80|	× 100% =  10/80 × 100% = 12.5%
              I was in error by 12.5%
             
Example: The report said the carpark held 240 cars, but we counted only 200 parking spaces.

            (|240 − 200|)/|200|	× 100% =  40200 × 100% = 20%
              The report had a 20% error.
